# SQL Library Manager

A library database Application that list, create, upate and delete books, using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize. I Used Pug to utilized the data from the database to display the various pages in the browser and routes to handle post and get requests. 

Download project files, and run "npm install" in root folder to install dependencies. Run "npm start" to start and view project local server.
